# hello-world
Just another repository
I am currently in my early stage of professional career. I currenlty work as SAS analyst at metsoft techonlogies where I work on different analytic techniques to benifit the company. I always belive in updating yourself with the new technologies that are available out in the market and I am willing to learn them and I think in work onne should always try achiving and extra mile. 
I love my current role but I always wanted to work in core financial sector and I am also looking for a full time employemnt as my present job is a contract.
